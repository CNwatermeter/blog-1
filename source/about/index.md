Welcome! This is [OverflowCat](https://github.com/OverflowCat)'s blog. The domain or site name, <ruby>新<rt>xīn</rt></ruby><ruby>世<rt>shì</rt></ruby><ruby>界<rt>jiè</rt></ruby><ruby>的<rt>de</rt></ruby><ruby>大<rt>dà</rt></ruby><ruby>门<rt>mén</rt></ruby>，lit. "the gate to a new world", is a Mandarin slang that describes a brand new experience, such as learning a new language or crossdressing for the first time. By using this term as the site name, I hope I am writing something new and inspiring, from computer science to language learning. The blog system will be changed in the near future, and comments will be added. Nevertheless, I believe you should check my [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@overflowcat) in Fediverse if you are not following me.
